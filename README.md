# DHT with LCD
This tutorial explains how to set up a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor and an LCD display that displays those values.

## Parts:
- DHT11 Sensor (temp & humidity)
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires
- LCD1602 + I2C Backpack

## Download and Install:
- Download and unzip the **DHT-with-LCD zip** file by clicking the green *Clone or Download* button above and selecting *Download ZIP*
- Unzip this file; all the files you'll need will be contained inside
- Unzip the **LiquidCrystal_I2C.zip** file, and drag the subsequent **LiquidCrystal_I2C-1.1.2 FOLDER** to the Documents/Arduino/libraries folder. 
- Unzip the **DHTLib.zip** file, and drag the subsequent **DHTLib FOLDER** to the Documents/Arduino/libraries folder.
- Now both libraries you need will be installed properly.

## Create the Arduino Circuit
- Open the **DHT_with_LCD_bb.pdf** and follow the visual pinout instructions to create your circuit

## IDE Code
- Double click the **DHT_with_LCD.ino** file to open the Arduino IDE. Upload the code to your Arduino and, VOILA! You should begin to see a temperature and humidity readout on your LCD.
